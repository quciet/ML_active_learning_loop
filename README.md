# Active Learning Simulation Loop

This repository contains reusable components for running an active learning loop
with lightweight surrogate models and synthetic test functions.

## Repository Structure

- `learning_loop/` — Core active learning and machine learning components:
  acquisition heuristics, ensemble training, surrogate models, and utilities.
- `data_simulation/` — Synthetic data generators and grid utilities.
- `testing.ipynb` — Main demonstration notebook showing the active learning loop in action.
- `notebooks/` — Reserved for optional future example notebooks.
